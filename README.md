# Strategic Team Check-in System

> A comprehensive meeting management platform designed for scientific research teams to transform chaotic check-ins into structured, productive discussions with clear outcomes and accountability.

## 🎯 Purpose & Intent

This system was designed specifically for fisheries research teams conducting **scientific research and stewardship of Anthropic fisheries**. However, it's adaptable to any organization managing strategic objectives across multiple operational levels.

### Core Problems Solved:
- **Meeting Chaos** → Structured agenda generation with intelligent prioritization
- **Silent Voices** → Ensures every team member provides input, even "don't know enough" responses
- **Knowledge Gaps** → Identifies areas where team members lack expertise for targeted training
- **Time Waste** → Smart time allocation with real-time tracking and flexible adjustments
- **Lost Context** → Comprehensive note-taking and automatic meeting summaries
- **Strategic Drift** → Visual pyramid tracking keeps focus on critical objectives

## 📊 Strategic Framework: The Priority Pyramid

The system organizes work across three hierarchical levels:

```
    🔵 CRITICAL - Major Projects & Events
         (Large-scale initiatives, critical deadlines)
    
      🔵 IMPORTANT - Key Milestones  
        (Deliverables, publications, major deadlines)
    
    🔵 FOUNDATIONAL - Operations & Support
      (Daily operations, procurement, QC, training, safety)
```

### Rating Philosophy
- **0-10 Scale** where 0 = Crisis/Disaster, 10 = On Track/Success
- **Knowledge Gaps** captured via "Don't Know Enough" option
- **Visual Indicators**: Green (rated), Orange (don't know), Gray (unrated)

## 🚀 Key Features
